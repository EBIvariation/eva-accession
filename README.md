# Build
To compile the whole project you only need to run `mvn clean install`.

You can use maven profiles (e.g. `mvn clean install -Pproduction`) to fill some required parameters and include them in the compiled jars/wars.

For a quick compilation without tests, you can run `mvn clean install -DskipTests`.

Look at the READMEs of each module for more details.
