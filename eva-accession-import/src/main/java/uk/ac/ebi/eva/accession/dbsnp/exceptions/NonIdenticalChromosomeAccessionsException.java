/**
 * This exception signals a possible issue with the chromosome accession equivalences in a species.
 *
 * Consider this (made up) example of an assembly report:
 *
 * # Sequence-Name	Sequence-Role	Assigned-Molecule	Assigned-Molecule-Location/Type	GenBank-Accn	Relationship	RefSeq-Accn	Assembly-Unit	Sequence-Length	UCSC-style-name
 * Chr01	assembled-molecule	1	Chromosome	CM002812.1	<>	NC_029977.1	Primary Assembly	301019445	na
 *
 * You can see how the GenBank and RefSeq accessions are not identical, but it doesn't assert whether the Sequence Name
 * (usual chromosome names) is identical to the GenBank accessions.
 *
 * We don't expect this to happen, but (at the time of writing)
 * {@link uk.ac.ebi.eva.accession.dbsnp.batch.processors.ContigReplacerProcessor} will replace the chromosome with the
 * GenBank accession if the 'forceImport' is set.
 *
 * Note that this doesn't apply if RefSeq is not available ("CM123.1 <> na") because then it's clear that the chromosome
 * is identical to the GenBank contig, and the replacement "chromosome to GenBank" can be safely done.
