Known issues
==================================

During the release process some issues were identified resulting in some species 
being completely or partially excluded from this release. The EVA is working to 
solve the issues so those species can be included in subsequent releases.

Zebu_9915 (GCA_000247795.2)
Mapped variants from dbSNP for this species could not be released due to technical problems with high cardinality
multimap variants i.e.,variants that map to too many different contigs/chromosomes

Mapped variants from dbSNP for the following species were completely excluded due to inconsistencies in the data:
Date_palm_42345 (GCA_000413155.1) - Based on the data from dbSNP FTP, the 
submission batches could not be definitively associated with the variant data
Plasmodium_5833 (GCA_000002765.1) - Insufficient data from dbSNP FTP
Trematode_6183 (GCA_000237925.2) - Insufficient data from dbSNP FTP

Mapped variants from dbSNP for the following species were completely excluded because an INSDC accessioned assembly
could not be identified for the variant mapping:
Platypus_9258 (1303499 variants) - No equivalent INSDC accessioned assembly (GCA) for 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002275.1/
Nematode_6239 (190570 variants) - No equivalent INSDC accessioned assembly (GCA) for 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002985.4/
Opossum_13616 (1188264 variants) - No equivalent INSDC accessioned assembly (GCA) for 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002295.2/
Bison_9901 (6 variants), Cow_30522 (2307 variants) - Btau_4.1 assembly 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000003205.2/) does not have equivalent INSDC 
accessioned assembly. Note that Cow_9913 was imported successfully (103095390 variants)

A very small percentage of variants for the following species were excluded because 
an INSDC accessioned assembly could not be identified for the variant mapping:
Mouse_10090 - MM_Celera assembly (0.01%) 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002165.2) does not have equivalent INSDC 
accessioned assembly
Chimpanzee_9598 - Pan_troglodytes-2.1 assembly (0.12%) 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001515.3) does not have equivalent INSDC 
accessioned assembly
Mosquito_7165 (0.5%)
Based on the data from dbSNP FTP, reference assembly could not be determined for 
variants in build 137
Rat_10116 (1.67%)
Based on the data from dbSNP FTP, reference assembly could not be determined for 
variants in build 125, 126, 130 and 136
